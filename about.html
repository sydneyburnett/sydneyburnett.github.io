          <p>Hi! My name is Sydney Burnett! I am a photographer from North Palm Beach; currently based in Miami.</p>
          <p>I shoot creative editorial projects as a photography director for a magazine about beverages, restaurants, lifestyle and culture in Miami. I also shoot advertorials for small businesses and collaborate with models on these campaigns to make brand visions come to life. I love to work with people, models and athletes on portrait shoots. </p>
          <p>In 2018, I launched my own photography business in Juno Beach, Florida. I will graduate from the University of Miami in Spring 2022 with a B.S. in Public Relations and minors in photography, marine policy and international studies. My passion for the environment and sustainable development has cultivated great areas of interest in energy and environmental law and marine and coastal policy. In my free time, I like to stay active, dive, surf, do yoga, curate music playlists and design magazine spreads!</p>
